# polygons

This will be used to demonstrate using Rust and WebAssembly
to improve the performance of an JavaScript application.
The user can create any of number of polygons,
each containing any number of points.
They can then rotate the polygons which requires matrix multiplication
that will be handled by either JavaScript or Rust.
We will compare the performance differences.
